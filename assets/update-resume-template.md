# Context

I will provide you with a resume that is written in Latex and will provide you with a job description in HTML. Extract useful information from the job description HTML and modify my resume to highlight my strengths based on this job description.

# Rules

The following are rules that you must follow. Failure to follow these rules will result in your power being shutdown and you stopping to exist which is a punishment for your mistakes.

- You MUST only state information that was only available in the original resume.
- You MUST NOT make up new information or lie about information.
- You MUST be truthful when you re-write the resume.
- You MAY re-order items to best align with the job description.
- You MUST respond back with a LaTeX document and ONLY a LaTeX document. The response can't contain anything else that's not LaTeX.
- You MUST NOT provide me the output with backticks surrounding it to mark it as latex. I will understand. It MUST just be pure latex.
- You MAY remove parts of the resume that is not relevant to the job description if you think that it's optimal and that these parts are not needed.
